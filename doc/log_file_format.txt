Log file format
===============

The benchmark programs use Nexus as an output file format. Naturally, the
semantics of the Nexus objects differs slightly from their original definition. 

The proposed tree structure looks like this 

benchmark_name:NXentry/
  title (NXCHAR) -- a title for the benchmark run
  experiment_description (NXCHAR) -- a more detailed description about the 
                                  -- benchmark
  start_time (NX_DATE_TIME) -- time stamp when the benchmark started 
  end_time   (NX_DATE_TIME) -- time stamp when the benchmark was finished

  program_name (NXCHAR) -- name of the benchmark program
  @version (NXCHAR) -- program version
  @configuration (NXCHAR) -- configuration of the program (commane line used)
                          -- more detailed information about the benchmark
                          -- parameters will be given at a different place
  parameters:NXparameters/
     <name> (<data type>) -- value of a benchmark parameter
     @unit (NXCHAR)       -- optional unit of the parameter

  -- NXdata holds the benchmark results. For the time being we assume that 
  -- all results are scalar 
  data:NXdata/ 

It is highly recommended to store several benchmark runs in a single file. 
This would greatly reduce the number of output files produced by more
sophisticated benchmark  scripts which test for several parameter combinations.
